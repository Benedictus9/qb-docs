## Radar

Codesign's police radar is a all-in-one is automated license plate reader (ALPR). They are attached to police squad cars. ALPRs are a system of cameras that automatically take photographs of vehicle license plates, compares those plates to a list of license plates that the police is looking for (a “BOLO list”), and notifies you when there is a match.

## Prop Placer

Prop placer features a small UI-based menu that allows players to select peaceable items. Every item can be rotated and moved to player preference. Placed or deleted props are synced across the server so every player can see them and interact. After placing the item it can be picked up and moved/deleted even after a script restart.

It is perfect for setting up RP scenarios for police, medics, mechanics, or gangs!
